### Hi there I'm Gina, a front-end engineer 👩🏽‍💻 currently working out of Boston.

As a ✨Latina✨, learning English I understood how important visual cues are for navigating the world around you. This incited me to go to school to learn about visual communication. 
Now as a professional I love to create engaging and functional web experiences for diverse audiences.

While being a developer by daylight, by moonlight: I enjoy playing D&D, board games, and video games; I also have a large plant collection that requires more attention than I expected and my dog Ody who also requires a lot of attention, however, this was expected.

If you want to know more about me or my work, feel free to contact me.
