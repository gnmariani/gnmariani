  <p>Hi, I'm Gina, a front-end engineer with a passion for UI and web accessibility. As a Latina, learning English I understood how important visual cues are for navigating the world around you. This incited me to go to school to learn about visual communication. Now as a professional I love to create engaging and functional web experiences for diverse audiences.</p>
  <p>While being a developer by daylight, by moonlight: I enjoy playing D&D, board games, and video games; I also have a large plant collection that requires more attention than I expected and my dog Ody who also requires a lot of attention, however, this was expected.</p>
  <p>If you want to know more about me or my work, feel free <a class="text-jade-powder" href="">to contact me</a>.</p>
